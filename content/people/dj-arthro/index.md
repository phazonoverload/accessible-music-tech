DJ Arthro is an Award-winning multi-instrumentalist, electronic music producer and instrument designer. As a live-performer DJ Arthro utilises a lot of Music Technology equipment - so much that he has described his set up as “The Spaceship”, which he plays using a variety of unorthodox techniques in order to achieve creative freedom. He has recently worked with Tim Yates and the team at Human Instruments to create LOOPFREE, a brand-new piece of tech that enables him to live-loop and create live and improvised music performances in new ways.
