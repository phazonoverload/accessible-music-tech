Andre is a versatile musician from London. gigging and composing many styles of music, he's played in Camden's renowned Jazz Cafe, the intimate food-venue Pizza Express and has been at the forefront of helping to make Native Instruments products more accessible to those with a visual impairment.
He had the privilege of being the first ever blind person to test out Komplete Kontrol's accessibility features before it hit the mainstream market, and has been a huge proponent of the software ever since.
In this ever-changing, ever-growing musical landscape of artists, Andre tries to find his own inimitable style and bring it to any project he's playing.
In recent times he's begun teaching blind students to use the industry-standard DAW, Logic Pro in hopes of giving them an outlet for their own musical creations.
