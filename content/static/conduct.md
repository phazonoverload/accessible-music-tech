title: Code of Conduct

At Accessible Music Tech we follow the [Berlin Code of Conduct](https://berlincodeofconduct.org/).

To report an issue during any of our events you can contact [conduct@accessiblemusic.tech](mailto:conduct@accessiblemusic.tech). 

At our events we expect everyone to respect the language choices of others regarding their own identity. This is especially important when referring to disability. Whether someone chooses to use 'person-first' or 'identity-first' language to describe their own disability, it is our responsibility to respect this.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately, failure to do so will result in removal from the event and all future Accessible Music Tech events.
